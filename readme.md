WP API Demo
===========

This is a simple demo Wordpress installation with a custom post type, taxonomy, and custom fields. It has the WP REST API plugin installed, along with a customized version of the basic auth plugin which allows API clients to authenticate with a WP username and password (please do not use basic auth in production!).

If you want to play around with this demo, you can clone this repository directly or fork it and make your own changes.

Where to find things
--------------------

All custom php code for the demo can be found in the "wp-api-demo" plugin. The "todo" directory in root contains the JS and CSS files for the todo list app. The HTML for that app is contained in the single-todo-list.php file in the Twenty Sixteen theme.
